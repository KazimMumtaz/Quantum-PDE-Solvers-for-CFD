Classical high‑fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers struggle with ever‑increasing resolution requirements and stiff nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Quantum algorithms, when carefully co‑designed with classical components, have the potential to unlock exponential state‑space compression and polynomial speed‑ups for CFD analysis in aeronautics, energy, and climate science.
